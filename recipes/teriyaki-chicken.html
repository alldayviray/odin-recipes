        <p>Easy Teriyaki Chicken that will become a weeknight staple. The simple marinade 
        <br> cooks into a delicious light glaze with just the right ratio of salty and sweet.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce </li>
            <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil, divided</li>
            <li> 1.75 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the marinade first. Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, 
                <br>garlic, ginger, and 1 Tbsp of the cooking oil in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken in a shallow bowl or dish, then pour the marinade over top.
                <br>Turn the chicken a couple of times to make sure it's well coated. Let the 
                <br>chicken marinate for 30 minutes to one day (refrigerated), turning the 
                <br>chicken occasionally as it marinates.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook the chicken, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a 
                <br>large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken, discarding 
                <br>the remaining used marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side or until cooked through 
                <br>and the liquid in the skillet has reduced to a light coating of glaze on 
                <br>the chicken.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5 minutes 
                <br>before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
