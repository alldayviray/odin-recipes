        <h2>Preparation</h2>

        <h3>MANGO JELLY</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Blend lime zest, lime juice, mango nectar, half of mangoes, and a small pinch of 
            <br>salt in a blender until very smooth.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Heat gelatin and ½ cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly 
            <br>until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in mango purée. Pour jelly 
            <br>into a 9x5" loaf pan. Carefully add remaining mangoes and stir to combine. Cover 
            <br>jelly tightly and chill until set, 20–30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Do ahead:</strong> Mango jelly can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled.</p>

        <h3>FLAN</h3>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°. Cook sugar and 1 Tbsp. water in a small 
            <br>saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved, then cook, undisturbed, 
            <br>swirling pan occasionally and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush as needed, 
            <br>until mixture turns deep amber, 7–9 minutes. Scrape caramel into another 9x5" loaf pan.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Whisk egg yolks, coconut milk, condensed milk, vanilla, and salt in a medium bowl to combine. 
            <br>Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into loaf pan with caramel. Cover with foil. Set inside 
            <br>a roasting pan and place on oven rack. Carefully pour hot water into roasting pan to 
            <br>come halfway up sides of loaf pan (a tea kettle makes this easy if you have one).</p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Bake flan until just set in the center (it should still wobble a little when gently jiggled) 
            <br>and barely golden on top, 55–60 minutes. Let cool (still covered), then chill until cold, 
            <br>at least 4 hours. </p>
        <p><strong>Do ahead:</strong> Flan can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.</p>

        <h3>CORN AND ASSEMBLY</h3>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Spread out corn on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle sugar and salt over, then drizzle oil over 
            <br>and toss to combine. Roast until crisped slightly but not yet browned and a little sticky, 
            <br>12–15 minutes. Let cool.</p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>Meanwhile, bring sago pearls and ½ cup water to a simmer in a small saucepan and cook until 
            <br>translucent and firm-tender, 8–10 minutes. Drain, then combine in a small bowl with coconut 
            <br>milk, stirring well to separate pearls. Let cool.</p>
        <h4>Step 8</h4>
        <p>Toast coconut in a small skillet over medium heat until edges start to brown and crisp, about 5 
            <br>minutes (be careful not to overcook).</p>
        <h4>Step 9</h4>
        <p>Cut flan into 1"pieces and divide some among tall glasses or wide bowls. Cut out mango jelly into 
            <br>desired shapes and arrange on top, then spoon in ice cream, condensed milk, shaved ice, 
            <br>strawberries, macapuno, palm seeds, corn, sago pearls, toasted coconut, red beans, and 
            <br>pinipig as desired.</p>
